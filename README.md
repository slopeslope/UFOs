# UFOs

The purpose for this project is to find areas where UFOs were sighted and it explains in detail including date, city, state, country and shape. We created a table to filter the data with for loops. The table goes through the data set and finds whatever is searched based on specific criteria. My recomendation would be to gather more data including videos and include a video along with the searched criteria.
